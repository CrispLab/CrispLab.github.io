 abstract = {Plant genome editing, particularly CRISPR-Cas biotechnologies, has rapidly evolved and drawn enormous attention all around the world in the last decade. The cutting-edge technologies have had substantial impact on precise genome editing for manipulating gene expression, stacking gene mutations, and improving crop agronomic traits. Following the global trends, investigations on CRISPR-Cas have been thriving in Australia, especially in agriculture sciences. Importantly, CRISPR-edited plants, classified as SDN-1 organisms (SDN: site-directed nuclease), have been given a green light in Australia, with regulatory bodies indicating they will not be classified as a genetically modified organism (GMO) if no foreign DNA is present in an edited plant. As a result, genome-edited products would not attract the onerous regulation required for the introduction of a GMO, which could mean more rapid deployment of new varieties and products that could be traded freely in Australia, and potentially to export markets. In the present review, we discuss the current status and prospects of plant genome editing in Australia by highlighting several species of interest. Using these species as case studies, we discuss the priorities and potential of plant genome editing, as well as the remaining challenges.},
