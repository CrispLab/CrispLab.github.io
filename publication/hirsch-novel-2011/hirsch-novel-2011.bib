It is not clear which activity mediates each of the diverse biological functions of FRY1 \textlessitalic\textgreaterin planta\textless/italic\textgreater.\textless/p\textgreater \textless/sec\textgreater \textlesssec\textgreater \textlesstitle\textgreaterPrincipal Findings\textless/title\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterA \textlessitalic\textgreaterfry1\textless/italic\textgreater mutant was identified in a genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants deregulated in the expression of \textlessunderline\textgreaterP\textless/underline\textgreateri \textlessunderline\textgreaterH\textless/underline\textgreaterigh affinity \textlessunderline\textgreaterT\textless/underline\textgreaterransporter 1;4 (\textlessitalic\textgreaterPHT1;4\textless/italic\textgreater). Histological analysis revealed that, in roots, \textlessitalic\textgreaterFRY1\textless/italic\textgreater expression was restricted to the stele and meristems. The \textlessitalic\textgreaterfry1\textless/italic\textgreater mutant displayed an altered root architecture phenotype and an increased drought tolerance. All of the phenotypes analyzed were complemented with the \textlessitalic\textgreaterAHL\textless/italic\textgreater gene encoding a protein that converts 3′-polyadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) into AMP and Pi. PAP is known to inhibit exoribonucleases (XRN) \textlessitalic\textgreaterin vitro\textless/italic\textgreater. Accordingly, an \textlessitalic\textgreaterxrn\textless/italic\textgreater triple mutant with mutations in all three XRNs shared the \textlessitalic\textgreaterfry1\textless/italic\textgreater drought tolerance and root architecture phenotypes. Interestingly these two traits were also complemented by grafting, revealing that drought tolerance was primarily conferred by the rosette and that the root architecture can be complemented by long-distance regulation derived from leaves. By contrast, \textlessitalic\textgreaterPHT1\textless/italic\textgreater expression was not altered in \textlessitalic\textgreaterxrn\textless/italic\textgreater mutants or in grafting experiments. Thus, \textlessitalic\textgreaterPHT1\textless/italic\textgreater up-regulation probably resulted from a local depletion of Pi in the \textlessitalic\textgreaterfry1\textless/italic\textgreater stele. This hypothesis is supported by the identification of other genes modulated by Pi deficiency in the stele, which are found induced in a \textlessitalic\textgreaterfry1\textless/italic\textgreater background.\textless/p\textgreater \textless/sec\textgreater \textlesssec\textgreater \textlesstitle\textgreaterConclusions/Significance\textless/title\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterOur results indicate that the 3′,(2′),5′-bisphosphate nucleotide phosphatase activity of FRY1 is involved in long-distance as well as local regulatory activities in roots. The local up-regulation of \textlessitalic\textgreaterPHT1\textless/italic\textgreater genes transcription in roots likely results from local depletion of Pi and is independent of the XRNs.\textless/p\textgreater \textless/sec\textgreater},
