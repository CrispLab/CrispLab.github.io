 abstract = {In order for plant cells to function efficiently under different environmental conditions, chloroplastic processes have to be tightly regulated by the nucleus. It is widely believed that there is inter-organelle communication from the chloroplast to the nucleus, called retrograde signaling. Although some pathways of communication have been identified, the actual signals that move between the two cellular compartments are largely unknown. This review provides an overview of retrograde signaling including its importance to the cell, candidate signals, recent advances, and current experimental systems. In addition, we highlight the potential of using drought stress as a model for studying retrograde signaling.},
