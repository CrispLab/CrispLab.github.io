While modern plant breeding has achieved steady increases in crop yields over the last century, on the current trajectory we will simply not meet demand by 2045.

Here, we highlight that stepping up to meet this grand challenge will increasingly require thinking ‘beyond the gene’.

Coupled analysis of protein degradation rates, mRNA levels, and protein abundance reveal that 57% of the nuclear-encoded enzymes with higher degradation rates also had high light-induced transcriptional responses to maintain proteostasis. In contrast, plastid-encoded proteins with enhanced degradation rates showed decreased transcript abundances and must maintain protein abundance by other processes.

Importantly, CRISPR-edited plants, classified as SDN-1 organisms (SDN: site-directed nuclease), have been given a green light in Australia, with regulatory bodies indicating they will not be classified as a genetically modified organism (GMO) if no foreign DNA is present in an edited plant. As a result, genome-edited products would not attract the onerous regulation required for the introduction of a GMO, which could mean more rapid deployment of new varieties and products that could be traded freely in Australia, and potentially to export markets.

It remains challenging to develop complete annotations of functional genes and regulatory elements in these genomes. Chromatin accessibility assays enable discovery of functional elements; however, to uncover the full portfolio of cis-elements would require profiling of many combinations of cell types, tissues, developmental stages, and environments. Here, we explore the potential to use DNA methylation profiles to develop more complete annotations. Using leaf tissue in maize, we define ∼100,000 unmethylated regions (UMRs) that account for 5.8% of the genome; 33,375 UMRs are found greater than 2 kb from genes. UMRs are highly stable in multiple vegetative tissues, and they capture the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions from leaf tissue. However, many UMRs are not accessible in leaf, and these represent regions with potential to become accessible in specific cell types or developmental stages. These UMRs often occur near genes that are expressed in other tissues and are enriched for binding sites of transcription factors. The leaf-inaccessible UMRs exhibit unique chromatin modification patterns and are enriched for chromatin interactions with nearby genes. The total UMR space in four additional monocots ranges from 80 to 120 megabases, which is remarkably similar considering the range in genome size of 271 megabases to 4.8 gigabases. In summary, based on the profile from a single tissue, DNA methylation signatures provide powerful filters to distill large genomes down to the small fraction of putative functional genes and regulatory elements.","tags":["DNA methylation","chromatin accessibility","cis-regulatory elements"],"title":"Stable unmethylated DNA demarcates expressed genes and their cis-regulatory space in plant genomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhikai Liang","Sarah N.

The ability to optimise beneficial agricultural traits depends on the precise control of genes in a crop plant’s enormous genome. Yet, identifying valuable gene control regions – also known as cis-regulatory elements – is like looking for needles in a haystack. The location of these regions is often not obvious and current detection technologies are impractically expensive and intensive. This PhD project aims to refine and implement a new technology, based on epigenomic profiling, that is expected to facilitate rapid and cost-effective discovery of all the control regions in a genome, enhancing our understanding of crop genomes and unlocking new avenues for agricultural improvement.\nIn this PhD project, the successful candidate will create and analyse genome-wide maps of candidate gene control regions (cis-regulatory elements) using epigenome profiling and next generation sequencing in cereal crops; for instance, barley, sorghum, wheat, rice, and maize. The functionality of select regulatory elements will be tested using traditional reporter assays in combination with massively parallel reporter assays (eg STARR-seq). This project will test our ability to utilise these regulatory maps to create new traits, by gene editing select regulatory elements using CRISPR. There will be opportunities to work in model species such as Nicotiana benthamiana as well as translational work in crops.\nCandidates should have an Honours degree, Masters by research, Masters by coursework or equivalent in Plant Biology or Plant Genetics, Biotechnology, Molecular Biology or a related field.

The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) accumulates during abiotic stress, signaling transcriptional changes that trigger physiological responses. Epigenetic modifications often facilitate transcription, particularly at genes exhibiting temporal, tissue-specific and environmentally-induced expression. In maize (Zea mays), MEDIATOR OF PARAMUTATION 1 (MOP1) is required for progression of an RNA-dependent epigenetic pathway that regulates transcriptional silencing of loci genomewide. MOP1 function has been previously correlated with genomic regions adjoining particular types of transposable elements and genic regions, suggesting that this regulatory pathway functions to maintain distinct transcriptional activities within genomic spaces, and that loss of MOP1 may modify the responsiveness of some loci to other regulatory pathways. As critical regulators of gene expression, MOP1 and ABA pathways each regulate specific genes. To determine whether loss of MOP1 impacts ABA-responsive gene expression in maize, mop1-1 and Mop1 homozygous seedlings were subjected to exogenous ABA and RNA-sequencing. A total of 3,242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in four pairwise comparisons. Overall, ABA-induced changes in gene expression were enhanced in mop1-1 homozygous plants. The highest number of DEGs were identified in ABA-induced mop1-1 mutants, including many transcription factors; this suggests combinatorial regulatory scenarios including direct and indirect transcriptional responses to genetic disruption (mop1-1) and/or stimulus-induction of a hierarchical, cascading network of responsive genes. Additionally, a modest increase in CHH methylation at putative MOP1-RdDM loci in response to ABA was observed in some genotypes, suggesting that epigenetic variation might influence environmentally-induced transcriptional responses in maize.","tags":["Abscisic acid (ABA)","epigenetic","Mediator of paramutation1 (MOP1)","siRNAs","Zea mays"],"title":"Epigenetic Regulation of ABA-Induced Transcriptional Responses in Maize","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Zhou","Zhi Li","Erika Magnusson","Fabio A.

By examining the power of our co-expression based GRNs to accurately predict co-varying TF-target relationships in natural variation datasets we found that presence/absence expression changes - rather than quantitative changes - of a TF, are more likely to associate with target gene changes.

Leaf messenger RNA and protein abundance, sugar and starch concentrations, and gas-exchange and elongation rates were measured on preexisting leaves (PE) already developed at 30/25°C or leaves newly developed (ND) subsequent to temperature transfer. Following a shift in growth temperature, there was a transient adjustment in metabolic gene transcript abundance of PE leaves before homoeostasis was reached within 24 hr, aligning with Rdark (leaf dark respiratory CO2 release) and An (net CO2 assimilation) changes. With longer exposure, the central respiratory protein cytochrome c oxidase (COX) declined in abundance at 40/35°C. In contrast to Rdark, An was maintained across the three growth temperatures in ND leaves. Soluble sugars did not differ significantly with growth temperature, and growth was fastest with extended exposure at 40/35°C. The results highlight that acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration is asynchronous in rice, with heat-acclimated plants exhibiting a striking ability to maintain net carbon gain and growth when exposed to heat-wave temperatures, even while reducing investment in energy-conserving respiratory pathways.","tags":["acclimation","cold","cytochrome c oxidase (COX)","heat","photosynthesis","respiration","rice","thermal stress"],"title":"Molecular and physiological responses during thermal acclimation of leaf photosynthesis and respiration in rice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Weiss","Chunfang Wang","Xiaojun Kang","Hui Zhao","Maria Elena Gamo","Colby G.

With the increasing availability of genomic resources for S. viridis research, highly efficient genome editing technologies are needed to create genetic variation resources for functional genomics. Here, we developed a protoplast assay to rapidly optimize the multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 system in S. viridis. Targeted mutagenesis efficiency was further improved by an average of 1.4-fold with the exonuclease, Trex2. Distinctive mutation profiles were found in the Cas9_Trex2 samples with 94% of deletions larger than 10 bp, and essentially no insertions at all tested target sites. Further analyses indicated that 52.2% of deletions induced by Cas9_Trex2, as opposed to 3.5% by Cas9 alone, were repaired through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) rather than the canonical NHEJ DNA repair pathway. Combined with a robust Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method with more than 90% efficiency, the multiplex CRISPR/Cas9_Trex2 system was demonstrated to induce targeted mutations in two tightly linked genes, svDrm1a and svDrm1b, at the frequency ranging from 73% to 100% in T0 plants. These mutations were transmitted to at least 60% of the transgene-free T1 plants with 33% of them containing bi-allelic or homozygous mutations in both genes. This highly efficient multiplex CRISPR/Cas9_Trex2 system makes it possible to create a large mutant resource for S. viridis in a rapid and high throughput manner, and has the potential to be widely applicable in achieving more predictable and deletion-only MMEJ-mediated mutations in many plant species.","tags":["CRISPR/Cas9","Multiplexed genome editing","NHEJ and MMEJ DNA repair","Setaria viridis","Trex2 exonuclease"],"title":"Optimization of multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 system for highly efficient genome editing in Setaria viridis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Crisp","Reza Hammond","Peng Zhou","Brieanne Vaillancourt","Anna M.

Prior investigations have provided valuable insights into associations between sRNAs and heterosis, often using a single hybrid genotype or tissue, but our understanding of the role of sRNAs and their potential value to plant breeding are limited by an incomplete picture of sRNA variation between diverse genotypes and development stages. Here, we provide a deep exploration of sRNA variation and inheritance among a panel of 108 maize (Zea mays) samples spanning five tissues from eight inbred parents and 12 hybrid genotypes, covering a spectrum of heterotic groups, genetic variation, and levels of heterosis for various traits. We document substantial developmental and genotypic influences on sRNA expression, with varying patterns for 21-nt, 22-nt and 24-nt sRNAs. We provide a detailed view of the distribution of sRNAs in the maize genome, revealing a complex make-up that also shows developmental plasticity, particularly for 22-nt sRNAs. sRNAs exhibited substantially more variation between inbreds as compared to observed variation for gene expression. In hybrids, we identify locus-specific examples of non-additive inheritance, mostly characterised as partial or complete dominance, but rarely outside the parental range. However, the global abundance of 21-nt, 22-nt and 24-nt sRNAs varies very little between inbreds and hybrids, suggesting hybridization affects sRNA expression principally at specific loci rather than on a global scale.

Such investigations are having a profound impact on our understanding and the utility of epigenetic information for agriculture.\nA major focus of our research is characterizing the inheritance patterns of DNA methylation and other epialleles, which contribute to the unexpected and non-mendelian inheritance of traits. We recently studied in detail maize plants that were passed through tissue culture (eg for transformation) and found accumulation of targeted, heritable changes in DNA methylation at unstable loci ​(Han et al., 2018)​. We are also continuing to study the inheritance of DNA methylation over generations in maize populations.\nIn contrast to maize, clonal horticultural species, like apple, present a unique opportunity to study and potentially exploit epigenomic regulation and inheritance within a single genetic lineage. We are tracking the inheritance and variation of epialleles in clonal apple lineages, which could relate to spontaneous variation and trait stability.\nEpigenome engineering in monocot crops Natural variation is a powerful resource for investigating the role of DNA methylation. However, using epigenome engineering tools including CRISPR, we are working to generate germplasm with far greater levels of epigenetic variation.\nCurrently, in crops species with large genomes, germplasm with even moderate reductions in DNA methylation are not available, severely limiting our ability to study the role of epialleles. We are also implementing tools for locus-specific epigenome editing in monocots. Ultimately, reengineering the levels of methylation will allow us to answer fundamental questions about the function of methylation throughout crop genomes. Future applications also include using epigenome engineering and synthetic biology to modulate epialleles for crop improvement.\nCryptic epigenetic variation In large crop genomes there are many silent loci, including protein coding genes, which are associated with DNA methylation ​(Eichten et al., 2013)​. These loci may represent cryptic variation. The extent to which these loci are expressed in a subset of members of a species is relatively unexplored in crop genomics due to the historical costs of sequencing technologies.\nWe are identifying cryptic variation in barley using comparative (epi)genomics in combination with the introduction of epigenome engineering tools. In the longer term we will use these varieties to develop Epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines (epiRILs) to uncover cryptic epialleles associated with trait variation through activating silent parts of the genome.\n","date":1572489322,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572489322,"objectID":"b8915b8c0f1eb59f5d7c8ab55915450c","permalink":"https://CrispLab.github.io/project/crop_epigenetics/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T21:35:22-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/crop_epigenetics/","section":"project","summary":"Epigenetic engineering, inheritance, and the roles of DNA methylation","tags":[],"title":"Crop epigenetics and epigenomics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter Crisp"],"categories":[],"content":"Our research focuses on the interface between epigenomics and plant memory.

While plants clearly retain some memories of past experiences, the extent to which the environment leads to heritable changes in the epigenome is unresolved ​(Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011)​. Despite expectations, the epigenome, in particular DNA methylation, is particularly resistant to many environmental perturbations ​(Crisp et al., 2016). We have demonstrated that DNA methylation is unresponsive to multiple stresses ​(Ganguly et al., 2017, 2018)​. One possibility is that rapid recovery mechanisms preclude lasting imprints of stress.\nCryptic stress resilience epialleles While DNA methylation may be relatively impervious to stress, beneficial but non-essential stress resilience alleles may have become silenced by DNA methylation over time. We hypothesise that stress resilience traits may be enriched among the cryptic epiallele variants. We aim to identify and characterize cryptic stress resilience traits using comparative genomics tools and epiRIL populations is crops such as barley and sorghum.\nStress recovery in crops As a second novel avenue towards enhancing stress resilience, we are investigating the tension between plant stress memory and recovery. This is an on going colaboration with the Pogson Lab, ANU. We have found that the transcriptome recovers from light-stress with incredible speed ​(Crisp et al., 2017)​. Our future interest is in examining whether various crops, including C3 (barley) and C4 (maize), also have mechanisms for rapid transcriptome recovery from light-stress.\nExtending prior work, we are constructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using RNA-seq from light-stress recovery time courses to identify factors important for both rapid deactivation of stress responses and for re-activation of growth and productivity.

Yet, recently developed technologies have enabled even the larger genomes to be completely sequenced and have provided unprecedented insights into the number, form and function of their genes and the landscape of their chromosomes.\nThe identification of sequences of protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, with their associated promoter, terminator and intron sequences, has become relatively straightforward and accurate. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are other regions within the genome that play an enormous role in regulating and coordinating gene expression. These regions are not easily identified bioinformatically, as they are often located a considerable distance from their target genes and do not have readily-distinguishable sequences.\nTogether with collaborators (Waterhouse lab, QUT, Australia; Schmitz Lab, UGA, USA; Springer lab, UMN, USA ), we are developing a novel methodology to efficiently and affordably identify gene control regions, known as ​cis​-regulatory elements, in large genome crops. Our preliminary analysis, together with prior studies in plants, suggests that ​cis-​elements are predictably marked by a distinct lack of DNA methylation; we term these “unmethylated regions” (UMRs) ​(Crisp et al., 2019)​.

A majority of the maize genome is derived from TEs that can be classified into different orders and families based on their mechanism of transposition and sequence similarity, respectively. TEs themselves are highly methylated and it can be tempting to view them as a single uniform group. However, the analysis of DNA methylation profiles in flanking regions provides evidence for distinct groups of chromatin properties at different TE families. These differences among TE families are reproducible in different tissues and different inbred lines. TE families with varying levels of DNA methylation in flanking regions also show distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility and modifications within the TEs. The differences in the patterns of DNA methylation flanking TE families arise from a combination of non-random insertion preferences of TE families, changes in DNA methylation triggered by the insertion of the TE and subsequent selection pressure. A set of nearly 70,000 TE polymorphisms among four assembled maize genomes were used to monitor the level of DNA methylation at haplotypes with and without the TE insertions. In many cases, TE families with high levels of DNA methylation in flanking sequence are enriched for insertions into highly methylated regions. The majority of the textgreater2,500 TE insertions into unmethylated regions result in changes in DNA methylation in haplotypes with the TE, suggesting the widespread potential for TE insertions to condition altered methylation in conserved regions of the genome.

Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both sal1 and xrn2xrn3 mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream gene. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 genes up-regulated in the sal1-8 retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of genes up-regulated in sal1-8. Using APX2 and AT5G43770 as exemplars, we genetically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.","tags":null,"title":"RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhaoxue Han","Peter Crisp","Scott Stelpflug","Shawn M.

There was evidence for a high rate of homozygous changes to DNA methylation levels that occur consistently in multiple independent tissue culture lines suggesting that some loci are either targeted or hotspots for epigenetic variation.

We previously established a lack of drought-induced methylome variation in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis); however, this was tied to only minor observations of physiological memory. There are numerous independent observations demonstrating that photoprotective mechanisms, induced by excess-light stress, can lead to robust programmable changes in newly developing leaf tissues. Although key signalling molecules and transcription factors are known to promote this priming signal, an untested question is the potential involvement of chromatin marks towards the maintenance of light stress acclimation, or memory. Thus, we systematically tested our previous hypothesis of a stress-resistant methylome using a recurring excess-light stress, then analysing new, emerging, and existing tissues. The DNA methylome showed negligible stress-associated variation, with the vast majority attributable to stochastic differences. Yet, photoacclimation was evident through enhanced photosystem II performance in exposed tissues, and nonphotochemical quenching and fluorescence decline ratio showed evidence of mitotic transmission. Thus, we have observed physiological acclimation in new and emerging tissues in the absence of substantive DNA methylome changes.","tags":["Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis thaliana","Chlorophyll","DNA Methylation","epigenetics","Genome","Plant","Light","NPQ","Photosynthesis","Photosystem II Protein Complex","Sequence Analysis","DNA","stress memory","Stress","Physiological","Xanthophylls"],"title":"Maintenance of pre-existing DNA methylation states through recurring excess-light stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhaoxue Han","Peter Crisp","Scott Stelpflug","Shawn Kaeppler","Qing Li","Nathan M.

In most situations, DNA methylation patterns are inherited quite stably. However, changes in DNA methylation can occur at some loci as a result of tissue culture resulting in somaclonal variation.

Plants that have been regenerated from tissue culture exhibit gains and losses of DNA methylation at a subset of genomic regions. There was evidence for a high rate of homozygous changes to DNA methylation levels that occur consistently in multiple independent tissue culture lines suggesting the existence of a targeted process for altering epigenetic state during tissue culture. The consistent changes induced by tissue culture include both gains and losses of DNA methylation and can affect CG, CHG or both contexts within a region.

Plants have mechanisms to allow for the stable inheritance of DNA methylation through mitosis or meiosis. This creates the potential for DNA methylation to provide epigenetic inheritance for traits in maize and other crops. Epigenetics refers to heritable transmission of information that is not solely attributable to DNA sequence. Several examples of epigenetic inheritance were first described in maize including paramutation, imprinting, and transposable element inactivation. There is evidence that DNA methylation is associated with each of these epigenetic phenomena. In addition, natural variation for epigenetic states may contribute substantially to variation among maize inbreds and could be an important source of variation for crop improvement. Advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling DNA methylation in Arabidopsis have provided clues to the genes and pathways likely to be important in maize. Recent technological developments have provided the opportunity to characterize the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation in the maize genome. This has provided insights into the patterns of DNA methylation in plant species with large, complex genomes and has led to the identification of potential cryptic genomic information that is silenced by DNA methylation.

Transcriptome (RNA-seq, qPCR, sRNA-seq, PARE) and methylome profiling during repeated excess-light stress and recovery was performed at intervals as short as three minutes. We demonstrate that 87% of the stress-upregulated mRNAs analysed exhibit very rapid recovery. For instance, HSP101 abundance declined two-fold every 5.1 minutes. We term this phenomenon Rapid Recovery Gene Downregulation (RRGD), whereby mRNA abundance rapidly decreases promoting transcriptome resetting.

This revealed extremely short half-lives ranging from 2.7-60.0 minutes for 222 genes. Ribosome footprinting using degradome data demonstrated RRGD loci undergo co-translational decay and identified changes in the ribosome stalling index during stress and recovery.

An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally-relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under repeated drought stress over five successive generations. Whilst drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation they did not correlate with drought responsive gene expression. Six traits were analysed for transgenerational stress memory and the descendants of drought stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought stress there were negligible conserved DMRs in drought-exposed lineages compared to unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or pre-existing differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.","tags":null,"title":"The Arabidopsis DNA methylome is stable under transgenerational drought stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melanie Carmody","Peter Crisp","Stefano D'Alessandro","Diep Ganguly","Matthew Gordon","Michel Havaux","Veronica Albrecht-Borth","Barry J.

Recent studies have revealed that more complex antagonistic and synergistic relationships exist within and between these pathways. As specific chloroplastic ROS signals are difficult to study, rapid systemic signaling experiments using localized high light (HL) stress or ROS treatments were used in this study to uncouple signals required for direct HL and ROS perception and distal systemic acquired acclimation (SAA). A qPCR approach was chosen to determine local perception and distal signal reception. Analysis of a thylakoidal ascorbate peroxidase mutant (tapx), the 1O2-retrograde signaling double mutant (ex1/ex2), and an apoplastic signaling double mutant (rbohD/F) revealed that tAPX and EXECUTER 1 are required for both HL and systemic acclimation stress perception. Apoplastic membrane-localized RBOHs were required for systemic spread of the signal but not for local signal induction in directly stressed tissues. Endogenous ROS treatments revealed a very strong systemic response induced by a localized 1 hour induction of 1O2 using the conditional flu mutant. A qPCR time course of 1O2 induced systemic marker genes in directly and indirectly connected leaves revealed a direct vascular connection component of both immediate and longer term SAA signaling responses. These results reveal the importance of an EXECUTER-dependent 1O2 retrograde signal for both local and long distance RBOH-dependent acclimation signaling that is distinct from other HL signaling pathways, and that direct vascular connections have a role in spatial-temporal SAA induction.","tags":null,"title":"Uncoupling high light responses from singlet oxygen retrograde signaling and spatial-temporal systemic acquired acclimation in Arabidopsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Crisp","Diep Ganguly","Steven R.

Plants are adept at rapidly acclimating to stressful conditions and are able to further fortify their defenses by retaining memories of stress to enable stronger or more rapid responses should an environmental perturbation recur. Indeed, one mechanism that is often evoked regarding environmental memories is epigenetics. Yet, there are relatively few examples of such memories; neither is there a clear understanding of their duration, considering the plethora of stresses in nature. We propose that this field would benefit from investigations into the processes and mechanisms enabling recovery from stress. An understanding of stress recovery could provide fresh insights into when, how, and why environmental memories are created and regulated. Stress memories may be maladaptive, hindering recovery and affecting development and potential yield. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous for plants to learn to forget. Accordingly, the recovery process entails a balancing act between resetting and memory formation. During recovery, RNA metabolism, posttranscriptional gene silencing, and RNA-directed DNA methylation have the potential to play key roles in resetting the epigenome and transcriptome and in altering memory. Exploration of this emerging area of research is becoming ever more tractable with advances in genomics, phenomics, and high-throughput sequencing methodology that will enable unprecedented profiling of high-resolution stress recovery time series experiments and sampling of large natural populations.

However, too much or too little light or rapidly fluctuating light conditions cause stress to plants. Rapid changes in the amount of light are perceived as a change in the reduced/oxidized (redox) state of photosynthetic electron transport components in chloroplasts. However, how this generates a signal that is relayed to changes in nuclear gene expression is not well understood. We modified redox state in the reference plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, using either excess light or low light plus the herbicide DBMIB (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone), a well-known inhibitor of photosynthetic electron transport. Modification of redox state caused a change in expression of a common set of about 750 genes, many of which are known stress-responsive genes. Among the most highly enriched promoter elements in the induced gene set were heat-shock elements (HSEs), known motifs that change gene expression in response to high temperature in many systems. We show that HSEs from the promoter of the ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2) gene were necessary and sufficient for APX2 expression in conditions of excess light, or under low light plus the herbicide. We tested APX2 expression phenotypes in overexpression and loss-of-function mutants of 15 Arabidopsis A-type heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs), and identified HSFA1D, HSFA2, and HSFA3 as key factors regulating APX2 expression in diverse stress conditions.

SAL1 accumulates in chloroplasts and mitochondria but not in the cytosol. sal1 mutants accumulate 20-fold more PAP without a marked change in inositol phosphate levels, demonstrating that PAP is a primary in vivo substrate. Significantly, transgenic targeting of SAL1 to either the nucleus or chloroplast of sal1 mutants lowers the total PAP levels and expression of the HL-inducible ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE2 gene. This indicates that PAP must be able to move between cellular compartments. The mode of action for PAP could be inhibition of 5′ to 3′ exoribonucleases (XRNs), as SAL1 and the nuclear XRNs modulate the expression of a similar subset of HL and drought-inducible genes, sal1 mutants accumulate XRN substrates, and PAP can inhibit yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) XRNs.

We report the cloning of the CAROTENOID CHLOROPLAST REGULATORY1 (CCR1) gene. The ccr1 mutant has increased shoot branching and altered carotenoid composition, namely, reduced lutein in leaves and accumulation of cis-carotenes in dark-grown seedlings. The CCR1 gene was previously isolated as EARLY FLOWERING IN SHORT DAYS and encodes a histone methyltransferase (SET DOMAIN GROUP 8) that methylates histone H3 on Lys 4 and/or 36 (H3K4 and H3K36). ccr1 plants show reduced trimethyl-H3K4 and increased dimethyl-H3K4 surrounding the CAROTENOID ISOMERASE (CRTISO) translation start site, which correlates with low levels of CRTISO mRNA. Microarrays of ccr1 revealed the downregulation of 85 genes, including CRTISO and genes associated with signaling and development, and upregulation of just 28 genes. The reduction in CRTISO transcript abundance explains the altered carotenoid profile. The changes in shoot branching are additive with more axillary branching mutants, but the altered carotenoid profile may partially affect shoot branching, potentially by perturbed biosynthesis of the carotenoid substrates of strigolactones. These results are consistent with SDG8 regulating shoot meristem activity and carotenoid biosynthesis by modifying the chromatin surrounding key genes, including CRTISO. Thus, the level of lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in higher plants that is critical for photosynthesis and photoprotection, appears to be regulated by a chromatin modifying enzyme in Arabidopsis thaliana.","tags":null,"title":"Regulation of Carotenoid Composition and Shoot Branching in Arabidopsis by a Chromatin Modifying Histone Methyltransferase, SDG8","type":"publication"}]
